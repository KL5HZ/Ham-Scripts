# Ham-Scripts

To make installing Ham Radio programs on Linux easier.

Start with making sure you have git installed:
```
sudo apt install git
```

Then, install everything with this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/KL5HZ/Ham-Scripts.git $HOME/Ham-Scripts && bash $HOME/Ham-Scripts/install-ham-scripts.sh
```

Or choose the Ham software you want and 'wget' the raw url of that script. Then run 'sh ./(file name)'.

To check for updates to the repo, run this command from your home directory:
```
sh ./Ham-Scripts/install-ham-scripts.sh
```

If there are other programs you would like to see in here or if you run into issues with the code, please make a post in the 'issues' tab or click the following link:
