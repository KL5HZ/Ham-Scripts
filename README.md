# Ham-Scripts

To make installing Ham Radio programs on Linux easier.

Start with making sure you have git installed:
```
sudo apt install git
```

Then, install everything with this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/KL5HZ/Ham-Scripts.git $HOME/Ham-Scripts && bash $HOME/Ham-Scripts/install.sh
```

Or choose the Ham software you want and 'wget' the raw url of that script. Then run 'sh ./(file name)'.

If there are other programs others would like to see here, please create a post in the 'issues' tab for it.
