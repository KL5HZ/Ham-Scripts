# Ham-Scripts

To make installing programs on Linux easier.

Choose the Ham software you want and 'wget' the raw url. Then run 'sh ./(file name).
Or clone the whole code and choose the scripts you want locally.

If there are other programs others would like to see here, please create a post in the 'issues' tab for it.
